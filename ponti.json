Fra 'Angelo di Corsica ascribed to the Congregation of St. Jerome, founded by Blessed Peter Gambacorti from Pisa, came shortly after 1393 with some of his companions from Rimini to Venice, and manufactured at the site of which is now a hospice speech. In 1396 there arose beside a chapel under the title of \"S. Mary full of grace and justice, \"especially in regard of Fra 'Giovanni da Ravenna, and the priest Leonardo Pisani, the noble Venetian. In 1455 the oratory trasformossi in a larger church, dedicated to the martyr St. Sebastian, which had its completion in 1468. In 1470, the fathers instituted a school under the invocation of the same saint.

Yea I lived in the fourteenth century the Inquisition. All ' time of the suppression of religious orders, the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari became the seat of a parish formed circondarii with those of St. Thomas, and St. Stephen's confessor, then suppressed, and other bordering districts, and the convent, together with the church and convent of St. Nicholas of lettuce, and the School of St. Anthony, was converted in 1815 in Archive, to use what you pay tuttora.Il \"Ponte dei Frari\" was manufactured for the first time, at the expense of Fathers, by virtue of the grant and the Great Council October 10, 1428, in replacement of another bridge nearby, already made sagging from age, it speaks of a document coll'anno 1382. In our time it was rebuilt. Fathers wanted the \"Ponte dei Frari\" was a place of immunity pei criminals, saying that dovevasi regarded as sacred, because at one time \"the church of Frari was there, et granda was there the chapel, which is now voltada.\" See Sanudo, \"Diarii \ufffd, Vol XL, p. 29.",

The \"Bridge of Milk,\" first of wood, you costrusse to our times in iron, and on this occasion he went demolished next Sottoportico appealed with the same name. The \"Bridge of Milk,\" or \"of late\" does remember the Sanudo in his \"Diary,\" under date of August 31, 1505: \"In this zorno,\" he says, \"is knowing how to fo quartered an Albanian, what Amazo treacherous Zuan Marco cao look, et before them fo Taja the man to the bridge of the late.

Meanwhile, the fact of the policemen went to the ear, that a beautiful evening evicted the bridge, and sat spy if anyone did the bad game, but it was all in vain. Finally they decided to summon the boat, and toured pel channel, they knew of a little light burning in a house next to poor people, which penetrated, were able to convince himself, that he was going to be the light reflected in the window of the School of S.

And 'well known that every parish church had its own chapter or college presbytery, and that each chapter had some houses granted titrated by the piety of the faithful lest, staying in them, they could always be prepared for the needs of the church and the parish. This reason is clearly explained in the words of the Synod of Patriarch Egidio (1296 comandasi where the titrated dwell in their houses, and sleep at night, \"he propter locorum distantiam, ecclesiae debitis clericorum Ministeriis defraudentur.\" Every titrated then had to keep in good order the house that venivagli delivered to residence, which would solevasi dinotare glue sentence of having to keep \"in height,\" phrase used in our day, saying he was \"in Conzo and in full.\" In process of time, however, the titrated emancipated themselves sometimes from the obligation to live in the houses above, whereupon we find in 1510 ordered by the patriarch Contarini that \"houses made of the goods of the church Sieno only inhabited and considered by those to whom they belong, and that use that are destined. What if those to which you do not live there, the other ministers suitable and canonice ordered the dress. If you will be leased, the pros go under renovation, convenient to the church, and are distributed among the ministers quotidie inservientes. \"Yea sometimes happened that gave titrated their homes with a rent to families vicious, and even prostitutes, abuse who sought to eradicate the Patriarch Giovanni Trevisan in his first synod held in the year 1564.",

Rocco, it was written that this brotherhood owned a house in the parish of St. Barnabas' Calle Longa, where he was the Turchette. \" They then face observation that the \"Calle delle Turchette 'leads precisely in\" Calle long \"of S. Barnabas, and that on the next homes scorgesi still carved the coat of arms of the brotherhood of St. Rocco.

Elizabeth Severi. \" Of these particular albergherie we talked about elsewhere. See Bressana (Calle etc. .. It seems then that later took on a private operator to conduct the 'House Feltrina \"on their own account, as in the Journal Veneto, titled\" New Postiglione, \"on April 29, 1786, we read the following notice: \"About a year ago has been exposed to the public under a sign of an inn this manifest: - In Venice Accommodation and only true Nobile Inn of the magnificent city of Feltre, transported from the district of S. Maria Zobenigo in Calle del Doge in S. Maurizio. - He opposed to this notice and teaches Mr. Lorenzo Ferri, true and legitimate operator for many years the Inn of Feltrina between the two bridges to St. Mary Zobenigo, and on the 7th of corr. was decided in favor of him the issue. With this judgment is ensured teaches him the ancient Feltrina SM Zobenigo coll'esclusione exposed in the Calle del Doge in St. Maurice, \"etc.. above The inn existed precisely in that building archiacuto, then owned by Malipiero, which is found in \"Campiello della Feltrina\" at the right hand of those who come from St. Mary Zobenigo, where afterwards lived the famous dialect poet Pietro Barbaro Buratti.Sembra that the desire to allude to the site later called \"Campiello della Feltrina 'when speaking of Ugolino Scrovegno, puts it this way: \"haveva this Ugolino a house here in Venetia where is the little square between St. Mary and St. Maurice Zobenigo, part of which he bought the Mr. 1367. et paved the way to make yourself more beautiful in ' go to St. Vido. \"",

        "History": "On the prospect of a future home, that despite the reductions, reveals the original style archiacuto, scorgesi a kind of altar of marble, which at the top has a painting of the Virgin and Child between two angels, and in ' lower in low relief sculptural another angel, standing, coll'ali open, in the act of blessing with his right hand a globe, decorated by the cross, which he held with his left hand. The figure of this angel, from the waist down, it remains covered by two shields noble crossed by a bar, coat of arms repeated on the shaft of the inner courtyard, which we, in the second edition of the \"Curiosity Venetian,\" we said to belong to the patrician family Nani . The Stork on the contrary in its code 3255, now deposited in the Civic Museum, you will find the emblem of the Soranzo. This might leave some perplexity as expressed on the marble, the coats of arms of the Dwarves and Soranzo appear similar, and only expressed in color, differ from each other in this, that the shield of the Dwarves is fine gold and vermilion, while the Soranzo is fine gold and blue. The following, however, discovery, made by Stork, shows quite clearly that he was right in his assertion fullest. At the shore of the building known as \"Angel,\" she read plugged into the wall a surplus of burial Roman inscription which is stated in the 'Collection of Ancient Inscriptions \"of the famous friar Giocondo da Verona glue note:\" Venet. Rivulo in S. Marci, in Ripa D. Lucae Sorantio. \" Soranzo was therefore the building, and as between 'Giocondo dedicated his' Collection 'Lorenzo de' Medici, who died in 1492, we see this occur occurred in the fifteenth century, which fact is confirmed by genealogists with the news that Luke Soranzo, son of Christopher q. Gabriel, was approved pel Great Council in 1419, and in 1432 with Elizabeth ammogliossi Dandolo from S. Benedict. In addition, under the image of the well of the building itself, designed by Grevembroch (Ms. to the Civic Museum) reads: \"Well angelically symbolized the Bridge of the Angel, was Soranzo and then the Barbarighi.\"\nReturning then to enrollment Roman sovraccennata, which is almost entirely corrupted by the time it goes like this:\n\nD. M.\nT. Mestrius\nT. L. Logismus\nV. F. Sibi Et\nMestriae\nSpiratae\nConiu.\nThe prof. Peter Pasini giudicolla the surname greek \"Logismus', belonging at the time of the Emperor Domitian, and riput\ufffd that this\" Mestrius Logismus \"was a slave emancipated by his good qualities by some member of the family mestria, famous in Venice earth, whence perhaps acquired the name of the land of Mestre.\nThen it is curious that the story is said to have given rise to the angel sculpture on the facade of the building. We will draw the \"Annals of the Capuchins' father's Boverio, drawing upon some of the same words to him. He says, therefore, the good friar who lived in the house predicted the year 1552 a lawyer of the Curia Ducale, which, for all he was devoted to the B. See, had increased the entry with dishonest gains. He invited them to dinner one day his father Matthew Bascio, first general of the Capuchins, and a man of most holy life, and told him, before sitting down at the table, to have a monkey in the house good and experienced in a way that served him in all its domestic affairs. He knew immediately the father, by divine grace, which under the guise celavasi a demon, and who allowed herself to come before the monkey, who was lurking under a bed, he told her - I command from God to tell us who you are, and for what reason you joined in this house. - I am the devil or for other purposes here I am led to TRAR me that the soul of this lawyer, who for many titles I should. - Why then, being so hungry you, you have not killed him, and brought thee to hell? - Just because, before going to bed, it is always recommended to God and to the Blessed Virgin that if once he omitted the customary prayer, I, without delay, carried him from the eternal torments. - Matthew's father, heard it, hastened to command the enemy of God soon I'll go out of the house. And by opposing them that he had been given permission not partir top of there without doing some damage. - Well, his father said, do some damage, yes, but that I just want you to prescribe, and no more! Forerai starting this wall, and the hole will serve to witness the incident. - The devil obeyed, and his father, he set to dine coll'avvocato, the shooting of his past life, and in the end dell'ammonizione, picking up one end of the tablecloth, and twisting it, miraculously made it out of the blood in great abundance, saying, be to the blood of the poor whom he sucked with many unjust extortion. Cried the doctor proprii the past, and warmly thanked the cappuccino of the pardon, and to express their fear, however, that hole left by the devil, and calling it unsafe to remain free until the gate to so fierce adversary. But among 'Matthew assured him, and ordered him to put that hole in the image of an angel, imperciocch\ufffd would flee at the sight of the holy angels bad angels. This success was so public, concludes the Boverio, a bridge, near the house where scorgesi with the Angel, nowadays is called \"Bridge of the Angel.\"\nIn spite of what is this story, repeated in Segneri (\"Christian Instructed\") and Code 481, Class VII, the Marciana with the title: \"Memorable Cases Venetians collected by the gentleman from S. Pietro Gradenigo Giustina, \"with little criterion is attributed to the year of grace 1552 while, besides the painting and sculpture dell'altarino seem older, it appears to be a law of 1502 which until then of the\" Bridge of the Angel \" although not yet erected in stone, bore this name.\nThe House of the Angel is also famous pledge frescoes by Tintoretto, of which, however, all that remains is a few languid track. Narrasi that having the emulators of the supreme painter rumored that he would have to put your hands and feet in order to conduct the enterprise, that bizzarrissimo ingenuity but painted in the exterior faces of the apartments many groups and figures of battles, but wanted to include a cornice amount of hands and feet that claim, grab, press, push, and, in this way making a mockery pleasantly dell'astio of the envious.",

        "History": ". Marco Tiberio da Parma, general of the Humiliated, erected about half of the fourteenth century, a church dedicated to St. Christopher with the adjacent convent. This church was later known as the Madonna of the Garden, or St. Maria odorifera, avendosi placed in it in 1377, an image of B. V. who was in a neighboring orchard. Threatening to fall in 1399, the M. C. awarded 200 gold ducats for rifabbricarla. The shameful vices to which s'abbandonarono in the fifteenth century forced the Humiliated, on request of the Government, Pope Pius II to expel them from their convent, and surrogarvi the Congregation of secular canons of St. Giorgio in Alga. Entrovvi this in 1462, and was confirmed in possession of the year 1473. He planned to rebuild the convent and the church, which we see today. And 'likely, however, that at that time you would leave intact the old facade, built by Tiberio da Parma. The secular canons were suppressed in 1668, and the convent of Our Lady of the Garden he bought in 1669 by the Congregation of the Cistercian monks, known as Lombardy, who lived in the monastery of St. ruinous Antonio di Torcello. But then, in 1787, also dismissed the Cistercians, the church came under the patronage of the public, setting uffiziarla to a rector and some priests. In 1810 it was declared oratory of S. Martial, and in 1841 the Austrian government ordered them at his own expense a general renovations, but to which, if we except the work of the facade, operated in 1845, they did not give in 1855. After that time the church cedevasi the military, which made storage of straw, so you catch it again only in 1864 the renovations, which ended in 1869. For some years it was made to replace the parish church of St. Marziale.Alla Our Lady of the Good lived Bartholomew, the architect of the so-called \"Porta della Carta\" in the Palazzo Ducale.

This palace was formed by the family Gerardi-Zecchini hill houses bought by Roberti in 1581, belonged then to Muti, and the Hospital of the Beggars, and finally to the Bartolini. Here lived Horace Bartolini, who was elected Grand Chancellor May 7, 1746. On the same ground scorgesi the palace Patarol, inherited in the past century by Rizzo, the memory of which also existed in more ancient times this location in the \"Sottoportico,\" and \"Sottoportico According to Rizzo,\" now disappeared. The Rizzo, who had grave in the church of Our Lady of the Garden, were ascribed to the nobility of Padua in 1689, and embellished in 1781 by the Republic of title of count. They died out in 1833.

Here lived the family From Agnella, which perhaps was called colloquially also Lamb, since, in accordance with Gallicciolli (\"Memoirs Venetian\"), belonged to it that \"Marinus Agnellus\" which was the pastor of St. Martin in 1152. A \"Lunardo Dall'Agnella by s. Maria Mater Domini \", during the War of Chioggia, offered his person familiar with all its cargo, and the pay of 150 men from oar for a month. In reward of such offer in 1381 he was ballottato pel M. C., but remained among the excluded, of which, as is known, accoratosi, died a few days after leaving no descendants. Of Dall'Agnella thus saith the Code 29 Class VII of Marciana: \"These were the Trevisana in Rivalta; were good conditione and Catholics, was a ser et Lunardo dall'Agnella merchant from Biave of contr\ufffd of Santa Maria Mater Domini, who offered to Lordship of Ven.a in time of war Chioza of 1381, and there he remained. He missed him med.o q.la family in 1393, and from this comes the name of the Lamb Bridge in Santa Maria Materdomini. \" The Count Florio Miari in his \"Historical Dictionary of Literary Artistic Belluno,\" Leonardo dall'Agnella ago that this belonged to the family of Belluno.\nThe \"Foundation of the Lamb\" was said at one time also \"Foundation Ca 'Bonvicini\" from the palace place on the opposite, which belonged to a noble family.",

        "History": "to S. James dall'Orio. A law of 1368 prescribed that every year, for a given time, you were to do in Venice the anatomy of corpses. We find that this operation eseguivasi first in different places, that is, in the church of S. Paterniano, in the hospitable of SS. Peter and Paul, in the convent of the Carmelites, in that of St. Stephen, what in the Frari, the Scuola di S. Theodore, or in some other private place.\nAround 1480 the doctor Alessandro Benedetti proposed the erection of an anatomical theater, but his project could only be carried out following two centuries, pel legacy of three thousand ducats of the patrician Lorenzo Loredan. The anatomical theater, therefore, with an adjacent school, s'aperse the day February 11, 1671 at the club which is placed in \"Field of S. James dall'Orio \"to N. A. 1507, and after the middle of the past century was restored and reopened. Then burned the night of 8 January 1800, shrank again, but in the simplest fashion, and served for some years to cadaveric sections. Currently they are at the Civic Hospitable, and the School of Anatomy is concentrated in the University of Padua.\nThe roads indicated, as well as \"Anatomy\" are called \"Ferenzuola,\" corruption of Firenzuola, or Fiorenzuola, family name cittadinesca. In one of the \"Mariegole 'belonging to the Scuola Grande di S. Which are ascribed to John the Evangelist brother in 1473 a \"Cristofolo Fiorenzuola officer to the Consuls' by S. James dall'Orio. And even in the beginning of the sixteenth century this family continued to have stable in that parish.",

Maria della Misericordia, called the Abbey, soared above 939 in a grassy ground, called Val Verde, or only Caesar of the Julii, said Andreardo, or by families and Giulia Moro joint together. In the first surrendered to hermits, monks and thus, probably Augustinians, who erected next to a convent, which perished in the plague of 1348, the prior, who alone was left on, he gave before his death his dignity to Luca Moro . These obtained in 1369 that his family should have the patronage of the church in perpetuity. The fa\ufffdade of the same was raised in the seventeenth century on the design of Clemente Moli, at the expense of Gasparo Moro eminent philosopher. The interior, however, threatened to fall, and it was preserved prior to the credit of Monsignor Pietro Pianton, who practiced radical restoration. This church closed in 1868 went, but was bought in 1884 by the Patriarch of Venice Domenico Agostini coll'intendimento to return to divine worship.\nAmong the priors of St. Maria della Misericordia is worthy of mention the pious and learned Jerome Savina, which obtained from Clement VIII for himself and successors the right to wear the miter and the crosier. Having been poisoned by a wicked priest in the sacred chalice, he wished before he died, June 9, 1601, which were to be pardoned from the sacrilegious murder.\nWe learn from an engraving of Lovisa that the \"Bridge of the Abbey\" was in the last century stone. So it was landed, and in 1833 rebuilt of wood.\nOn the \"Foundation of the Abbey,\" in the so-called \"New Court\", the Scuola Grande di S. Our Lady of Mercy had a hospice, or, as was said, hospice, pei brothers poor. The entrance of the Court over the arch is decorated by a sculpture of the B. V. and Saints, and below is an inscription from which we learn that the factory of those houses was begun and completed in 1505, under the principality of Leonardo Loredan.",

Unitas to another brotherhood, which in honor of the same saint existed in S. Giuliano, built in 1478, a temple sacred to St. Roch, and in 1481 was ascribed by the Council of X between large schools of the city. By means of two monks Camaldolese Yea in 1484 failed to steal from Voghera the body of his patron saint. But then, for reasons unknown, he went away in the same year by the Frari, the church erected landed, and trasferissi at a site in the parish of St. Samuel, where stood an ancient chapel dedicated to S. Susanna. There was going to build a new church, when mutated council, established his residence in the palace of the Patriarch of Grado's Eve. Thereafter, the insurgents some quarrels, he returned to St. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari and made new agreements with Fathers Minor, raised in 1489, the church in honor of San Rocco, and traslatovvi the body of the saint. Three years later costrusse the first school, which later expanded and he restored. It still exists under the name of \"Ragionateria Old\" or \"Old School.\" Then about 1516, devotees reached the number of 500 brothers, wanted to erect a larger and more magnificent building for their meetings. It seems that, over a pre-existing model, the teacher incominciasse Bartolammeo Good, who was replaced by Sante Lombardo, and finally the Scarpagnino. The factory was completed in 1549 and cost 47,000 gold ducats. The Brotherhood of St. Rocco had in the past century about 60,000 ducats income, most of which were dispensing to the relief of the poor. As a reward for these charities, Pope Pius VI in 1789 innalzolla above the other, giving it, with many spiritual prerogatives, the title of Arch-confraternity. In general suppression of 1806, so do not let themselves exist that the fraternities of the SS. Sacramento, the Confraternity of S. Rocco was the only respected. The demesne took upon its income but substituted a convenient check pell'uffiziatura of the church. This association flourishes all the day long, and has many confreres especially in the class of Mercadanti. In the school of S. Rocco is exposed publicly on the day of the Holy paintings of the young Venetian masters.",

These roads, a time subject to the parish of San Geminianus, took their name from a tavern, which is still open in the name of \"Stand.\" We have a lot of data to believe it one of the oldest in Venice. In that \"Mariegola\" of the Scuola Grande di Santa Maria della Misericordia, which Principia coll'anno 1308, and reaches to 1499, is found ascribed as a brother \"Giacomello De Gratia from Stand\ufffd from San Geminianus, which is probably that same \"James the Cavaleto, \"which in that parish made loans to the Republic in 1379. In 1398 a \"Zaninus from Cavaleto tabernarius to Cavaletum in S. Marco \"had a conviction for use in your tavern wine jars of lower seal prescribed. An 'de Alemania Armanus q. Petri hospes to hospitium Cabaleti in S.to Marco ', having fenced at Catterina from Ferrara, a girl of about 10 years, which, for fear of beatings, had run away from home, and had been found weeping in the evening at the church of S. Mark Nicholas from a German prestinaio, took away that same night the flower maiden. He therefore, by judgment of 25 September 1413 he was sentenced to a year in prison and to a fine of 100 ducats, to settle the \"Chamber of Imprestidi,\" to marry the girl at the time. This being passed to another life, the fine is devolved to the City, but the landlord had the grace to pay it in installments of 10 ducats per year. The Inn of the 'stand' trovavasi also open in the sixteenth century, namely in 1566 was led by a certain \"Brunetto,\" which led close to another tavern full of \"Leon White.\"\nThe \"Calle del Stand\" is called also \"Calle Side of the Church\" because it runs along the oratory of S. Gallo.\nHaving Messer Bernardo Giustiniani q. Lorenzo q. Bernard, by S. Moses, conspired a long time, leaning against the 'Bridge Trestle, \"also called\" Bridge Field Rusolo, \"with a woman in there domiciled, former servant of Nicol\ufffd Aurelio, Secretary of the X, and then married to a scribe to\" Magistrate of the Forestier, \"and being the same glue to enter the house, was mortally wounded, out of jealousy, by Messer Angelo Bragadin, q. Peter, July 6, 1515, three hours at night. Strascinatosi put up in the \"Field Rusolo,\" there fell, and in the morning he was found cold corpse. Sanudo says: \"And 'STA acerbissimo caxo and miserable, the more so\" (Giustiniani) \"ruled the famegia soa and havia optima fame among all. It was nice and wise, but the faza \"(had)\" manzata from varuole; proportionato in reliquis well. He was the co zipon sc\ufffdfia in the head, et without arms. \" For this crime the Bragadin, summoned to appear and which had become contumacious, was banned capitalmente 14 August of the same year.",

In it scorgevasi a small church, dedicated to St. Mark, because, according to vulgar tradition, this was the place where he had've been attacked by the Evangelist fair gale, and eragli appeared an angel saying: \"Pax tibi Marce evangelista meus,\" and profetizzandogli the future foundation of Venice. The vineyard, of which we speak, together with the church and a few workshops, was left by will, June 25, 1253, by Marco Ziani Count of Rab, son of the Doge Pietro, the 'Friars Minor', or 'the Friars Preachers', or' Cistercians. \" They were given the preference of the Minor, who stopped stable home. Sprung up as a result the number of them, they had to expand their convent, and erected a new church on the design of Marino from Pisa, which is called S. Francesco della Vigna, leaving intact, however, that of S. Mark, who remained standing until 1810 in the garden of the Fathers. Threatening the church of S. Francesco ruin in the sixteenth century, it was decided to rifabbricarla above designed by Sansovino, and the first stone was laid on the work day on August 15, 1543. Insurgents, however, some dispareri, was for some time intermesso work, and consultossi the friar Francesco Giorgi, who released over the rifabbrica his opinion in writing, he had to comply with the Sansovino. Not even liked the design of the facade designed by this architect, and was chosen another design presented by Palladio in 1562. Allude to these contentions probably the inscriptions that appear in intercolunnii of the two wings, where one side is written: \"Do not sine Jugi inner\" and the other \"Exteriorique beautiful.\" Finally accomplished the church, had consecration August 2, 1582 by Julius Superchio Bishop of Caorle. The convent was on that occasion some renovations, but, during the reign of the Napoleonic suppression of religious orders, was, like many others, reduced to barracks.

In 1150 or 1155, the Crociferi, vulgarly \"Crosechieri,\" with the help of certain Peter Gussoni, or Cleto Grausoni, built a monastery in this situation, a hospital, and a temple dedicated to St. Maria Assunta, which was rebuilt after the fire of 1214. Commendation passed all the convents of the order of the Crociferis, this St. Maria Assunta was granted in 1464 to Cardinal Pietro Barbo, and then to the famous Bessarion, who died in 1472. Meanwhile, as the Crociferi fallen into a great laxity of morals, the Senate tried at the S. See who were expelled from their convent, and there sottentrassero Franciscan nuns. But neither the Franciscans nor the Canons Regular of St. Spirit, nor the religious Served, all intent at various times to have the convent mentioned, they could get on top of their desires. It was a prey to the flames in 1514, and was therefore a rifabbrica. Following Pius V laugh at the Crociferi all rents of commanderies, already confiscated, and they went in 1568 to regulate the reform. However, since the fathers fell back in their errors, Innocent X suppressed 21 of their convents, leaving only 4 exist, the head of which made for this in Venice. The four survivors were finally suppressed by Alexander VII in 1656 in order to assign the goods to the Republic, troubled by the war of Candia. At this juncture the Jesuits, who in 1606, in disputes between the Republic and Pope Paul V, had left Venice, returning, bought fifty thousand ducats to the monastery of the Crociferis, and in 1657 we stared at home. The church had been falling, he took in 1715 to raise it up from the foundations, and in fifteen years was accomplished on a design by Domenico Rossi. G. Baptist Fattoretto erected the facade. Suppressed the Jesuits in 1773, the monastery served to their use of public schools, and in 1807 the barracks. The church remained officiated as a subsidiary of the parish of SS. Apostles, until 1844, when it returned to the Jesuits, who took to live in a home adjacent to the \"New Fondamente,\" where, although small in number, live tuttora.In \"Field of the Jesuits' there is the ancient hospital of crucifers, which in the thirteenth century was benefited by Bertoldo patriarch of Aquileia, and the Doge Renier Zeno. Open from the very beginning to the poor and infirm of both sexes, from the mid-fifteenth century it does not host that poor women. The adjoining chapel, rebuilt in 1553, was a sacred time to the Blessed Virgin, but in 1844 it was granted by the Directorate of the House of Refuge and hospices to the Brotherhood of Sts. Philippe and Louis, whereupon presently has these owners. See: Bellomo, \"Historical and picturesque Oratory of SS Philip Blacks and Luigi Gonzaga. Venice, Molinari, 1846. \" This oratory he restored in 1881. It portrays the verci (\"History of Ecelini\" that in the Hospital of the Crociferis was solemnly sworn peace June 23, 1221 between the Patriarch Berthold, and the Venetians. Facevasi In the same field the game of football. We have a table, published by Domenico Lovisa , that it is playing in that location, interesting table because, beyond the facade of the church of the Jesuits without statues, will you spot the school of \"Varoteri\" (furriers spring at the bottom of the field, and the arc subject to which he had access to \"New Fondamente.\" The game of football was banned in \"Field of the Jesuits\" by decree of the Council of Ten, April 21, 1711.",

Here you can see an ancient body of factories, mostly tampered with and modernized, which stretches from the \"Rio della Sensa\" to that of \"Our Lady of the Garden,\" and has embedded in walls three statues of men dressed to the east (a of which is well known by our people under the name of \"Zior Antonio Rioba\" then finishing with a palace archiacuto, having carved on the facade, the side by the aforementioned \"Rio of Our Lady of the Garden,\" a man, though it in costume Eastern Europe, who is leading a camel, as well as ancient altar. All writers believed until now that these were the remains of the ancient storehouse of the Moors, or Saracens, but it is certain that in stead that the buildings described above were lifted from the family Mastelli , the authors of which were the three brothers Rioba, Sandi and Afani, came from the Morea, and therefore grossly Mori appealed, that the statues are images of the same, and thus was born the name to the nearby streets. We read in this regard in a chronicle (Class VII, No. 27 of Marciana: \"In the years of Sig.re MCXII three brothers Greeks, Rioba, Sandi et Afani, for seditioni civil fuggitisi from the Morea, where held many giurisditioni, took refuge with large possessions in Venetia, built et the abitationi their very honorevoli below the Ponte dei Mori, so called for the figures of the three aforesaid brethren, that in the corners of the factory together with the names they are seen carved. \"And another chronicle puts it this way in the Code\" are to be seen nowadays the old abitationi the house Mastelli below St. Mary of the Garden, et especially the ruins of a palatial building, the corners of which are placed three large marble figures of men dressed in the Greek, which supporting the whole building , holding on his shoulders a burden, even like a suitcase for dimostratione perhaps the wealth they brought in Venice, in which are carved the names of the first three authors of this house, et for this reason there near the bridge, which crosses the Grand Canal of Mercy, is called the Moors. \"To then prove the veracity of the two chronicles, the second of which exchanges the\" Rio della Sensa \"with that of\" Mercy \", as in the courtyard of the palace would add that on the camel the prospectus, which can be accessed through the door located in \"Campo dei Mori\" at No. 3381, scorgesi still a ring of well adorned with a shield with a checkered bar, family coat of arms Mastelli, repeated well over a hearth of the apartments higher. This family, which was the ancient councils, in 1202 he took part in the crusade led by the doge Enrico Dandolo. Later, remained in citizenship, and appearing solely to commerce, opened in \"Cannaregio\" a warehouse of spices in the name of the \"Camel , \"in allusion perhaps the camel carved on the building. bought it by the Dominion jurisdiction over the said step of Moranzano sul Brenta, and abandoned the trade, expected to enjoy in peace the riches collected until 1620, when he went extinct in an Antonio, Gaspare's son Mastelli and Laura Turloni. Here, according to the Stork, the reason why the people of the primitive name Rioba, leading one of the statues mentioned above, added to Antonio. Nevertheless, the palace of the Camel was already past a few years later in the family Priced, having Paola, born Nicholas Mastelli, and wife of Peter Dardanians, given as a dowry to his daughter Angela, congiuntasi in marriage with Marcantonio Priced. The Gradenigo, that 'his' Notatori \"picked up things Milder happened in Venice, said that in 1757, when this building was owned by the notary Pietro Priced, were heard for several consecutive nights playing the same hour all the five bells inside the rooms. Hence there arose a lot of fear, fainting women, dug out of the blood, and went so far as to implore the blessing of the priest, and, this being worth anything, to call the school chaplain of S. Fantino (solemn exorcist hunted into exile because the alleged evil spirits. E 'likely that the body of factories built by the Mastelli also formerly belonged to the palace of Jacopo Robusti, known as Tintoretto, located on the \"Foundation of the Moors' at NA 3399, although it is known that the famous painter Francesco comperollo Schietti instrument with 8 June 1574, in acts John Fanio . In these thresholds Jacopo gave his home until May 31, 1594, the day of his death. The same stable afterwards passed into the hands of his son Domenico him, and indeed it is stated that he wanted to leave it to the painters as a study of the drawings, models and reliefs of his father, but had to disgust, way change of opinion. It was later owned Octavia, sister of Dominic, and wife of Sebastiano Casser, the descendants of which owned it until today.",

Marco. \" See Remer (Campiello. Yet it is certain that in stead have originated the name that the wars of the canes and sticks, fists and afterwards, that you were here. See Pugni (Bridge of. And it should first be noted that many stretch bridges of Venice, who were shad in these fights, They called themselves \"War\", so in the \"Help\" Coronelli we find the \"Ponte della Guerra\" within the Giudecca Canal, the \"Ponte della Guerra\" in St. Martial, the \" Bridge of War 'in S. Fosca, and the \"Bridge War\" to St. Barnabas, the last two of which still retain the footsteps imprinted pei wrestlers. Turning now to speak particularly of the \"Ponte della Guerra\" in San Giuliano, Sanudo remembers that 29 December 1509 is prohibited \"batagiole\" on the \"Bridge of St. Julian.\" In 2078 we read code Stork under the year 1546: \"Above the Ponte della Guerra, a San Zulian made their fists.\" And we finally have a booklet stamped in Venice \"Salizzada S. Moise\" in the same year in 1546 with the title: \"Four of the songs in the Eighth Rima Battles and Battagliuole made above them Bridges of Venice in S. Zulian, St. Barnabas, Crocecchieri, and S.Marcuola. \"Even the 'Sottoportico War' in S. Sofia took the appellation mentioned by the fighting, used to stand over the next bridge called in the past\" Bridge of the War of the Grass Field \", then\" Bridge War or Priuli, \"and now\" Ponte Priuli \"only (Code Stork 620. Here we note in passing that the old palace overlooking the\" Sottoportico War 'in Santa Sofia, belonged to the patrician family Benedetti, as you can see the coat of arms carved on a diamond pattern facade, and on one side of the factory, as well as the Topographic plan of Venice, along with the \"Help\" Coronelli, where the adjacent bridge, now destroyed, is called the Benedetti., this palace is mortally wounded by robbers, ceased to live in 1658 Vincenzo q. Pietro Benedetti, dying in him famiglia.Quanto the \"Rio della Guerra\" in Castello, at the Virgins, it, according to the same Dezan and Berlan, remind one of those fights that took place between the Caloprini fairs and Morosini. really tells the story of that kind at the time of Doge Pietro Tribune, on account of women, a great enmity between these two families, Caloprini wounded to death in 'Field of S. Pietro di Castello \ufffdDomenico Morosini, and a' other time four Morosini killed three Caloprini while they were in the boat. But nothing definite can be said on the subject, and indeed others believe that the \"Rio della Guerra\ufffd next, as it lies, the 'Dock' of '' Brand New Arsenal ' , abbiasi entitled by canals from the war, which were built in the yards there places.",

He became famous for a statue of the Blessed Virgin who, according to tradition, made by a pastor of Rimini, and placed in a boat at the discretion of the waves, came in 1286 to the shores of this church, and was placed in it coll'intervento the prince and the Senate.

Apostles anciently had some renovations, and was renewed in 1575 and consecrated by the Bishop of Trogir, Guido Antonio. Later, ie the middle of the eighteenth century, the architect Giuseppe Pedolo gave modern form, leaving intact, however, the chapel Cornara. Even in recent times were added to the church of SS. Apostles new restorations and decorations. The parish, probably as old as the church, had broad application in 1810 pell'aggiunta part of the suppressed parish of St. Sofia, and other neighboring districts. In it sviluppossi in 1105 a fierce fire, which in Sanudo (\"Lives of the Dukes of Venice\" we find the following notes: \"In this year, 1105, of gennajo, went out fire from the house of Henry Dandolo, or Zeno, in SS. Apostles, and it was so great that many districts et BURN BURN the whole of said district, and with the fury of wind passed over the Grand Canal, et BURN S. Cassano, S.

The one was called the Castellani and the other of Nicolotti. The first was made by the inhabitants of the eastern parts of the city, at the end of which lies Castle, the second by the inhabitants of the western parts, which are conterminate from S. Nicol\ufffd dei Mendicoli. The Castellani led to the distinctive red cap and scarf, the Nicolotti, however, the cap and scarf blacks. Nothing is known about the precise origin of these factions. Who does derive from those of civil wars between Eraclea and Jesolo those, after which the one and the other came to settle in these islands. About the killing of a bishop of Castello, which took place at the hands of Nicolotti. The government fed the rivalry of the two parties to have courageous men and trained to fights, and perhaps to keep divided the subjects so that, if a portion had ever raised, the other was ready to suppress the rebellion. Where the Castellani and Nicolotti trying to outdo each other better, it was in the so-called battle of fists, which sottentr\ufffd the war of the canes, or sticks. This fight was allowed from September to Christmas, and facevasi mostly over the bridges, among which were the preference to S. Barnabas, of which we speak now, and that therefore he was called \"Ponte dei Pugni,\" and S. Fosca. The two bridges are on the corners of the square The footsteps where the wrestlers had to place their feet, and one of them still been preserved \"without bands,\" custom adopted with the pitiful end of the fighters, falling easily into the water, they were soon forced to separate, and desist dall'ire. The battle of fists continued until 1705, at which time it was strictly prohibited. Imperciocch\ufffd the 30th September of that year the \"Ponte dei Pugni in S. Barnabas \"was the scene of bloody struggle, which began hill battle, and ended up with stones and knives. There were so intent commoners who, having developed a fierce fire in the monastery of S. Jerome, spiccarsi no one wanted to pay it off, and it was behooves a priest of St. Barnabas comes out with a crucifix in his hand to separate the combatants. In the last days of the Republic and the Castellani Nicolotti were forced to confine themselves to tenders and exertions less cruel, such as \"Strength of Hercules' and 'Race'.",

He had a rifabbrica after the fire of 1105, and from 1140 it came under the jurisdiction of the Benedictine abbots of St. Hilary. When this famous abbey stood destroyed in 1247 by the tyrant Ezzelino, the abbots with the monks retired to Venice hinted at their church, and Fridiano, one of them, the he restored, as is believed, in 1342, at the same time at the monastery. After 1450, the abbots were replaced by the regular abbots commendatarii, the first of which, Bartolammeo Paruta, RESTORING returned to the church of S. Gregory, who was no longer officiated by monks but by a chaplain and other priests, who are elected by the abbots, and having spiritual care in the district. Finally in 1775 the title was suppressed abbey, and instituted to the parish priest. The church of S. Gregory was secularized in 1808. At the end of the \"Rio di S.

The chronicle Scivos assures us that the parish church sacred to St. Euphemia, Dorothea, Thecla and Erasma, martyrs in Aquileia, was-constructed in 865 under the doge Bear Partecipazio. After being then restored several times, was reduced to its present form in the middle of the past century. He must have had various consecrazioni, of which we know nothing, however, that the eccettuatane 1371 ricordataci engaged by a plaque at the door. In 1810 the parish seat is moved from the church of S. Eufemia in that of SS. Redeemer to be fine again transported to St. Euphemia when the Capuchins in 1822 regained their ancient possessions. Andrea Davanzago, parish priest at St. Euphemia of Giudecca, having died in 1437 some Mina, led some girls to testify that the deceased, by his will nuncupativo, had left all his possessions. Therefore the first quoted Quarantia Criminal, said in a thousand pappolate exculpate himself, verbigrazia that Mina, dying, had given birth to two children \"in tendentes invisible\", the first of which in 1440 had to be pope, and the second emperor, adding words to modesty, say 'rasps', is passed over in silence. His defenses, however, earned him nothing, since, by judgment of 9 August of the same year 1437 he was sentenced to return to the relatives of Mina, which lay in poverty, as they believed the goods of it, and to remain in prison until the time of 'full refund.",

It is located in the Palazzo Querini this field, known as the 'Ca' Mazor ', or' Ca 'Granda \"which, after the conspiracy Tiepolo-Querina, which occurred in L310, was demolished to two-thirds due to Marco and Pietro Querini conspirators, and left intact for another third owned by Giovanni Querini innocent. Some chronicles say, however, instead, that, then, the instruments rinvenendosi divisional, and a multitude being in that house some common parts, and therefore indivisible, the government did he leave standing as he was, but confiscated two-thirds of Marco and Pietro Querini, and bought the third of John. He is certain that here in 1339 were placed public Beccherie Rialto, located mostly in before S. John Elemosinario where afterwards was the \"drapery\". This way the name 'Stallion', which retains the building. Neither pretermettere willed it, however briefly, returned in the siege of Venice in 1849 to serve the public slaughterhouse being that of S. Job exposed to the hail of balls.\nThe commission of edible meat was never neglected by the Venetians, were encountered from ancient times until the establishment of an office of three noble, so called 'Above the Beccarie and public butchery, \"whose chapter records the deliberations on this matter issued from the beginning 1249. He kept it with variety of laws up to 1545, at which time an extraordinary heaviness imposed by the King of the Romans over the extraction of bovine animals produced a severe famine. Then the Senate decreed that they were elected two individuals of one's body with the title of \"Superintendents over the Beccarie,\" and in 1678 there added a third. See Tentori (\"Essay on the History of Civil etc.. Republic of Venice\"). The Butchers gathered in devout brotherhood, under the patronage of St. Matthew, in the church that stood in Rialto sacred to this saint, which, for a short Eugene IV, had the right to elect the rector. They masked in European, the Asian, Africana, and Americana, especially in segnalavansi hunts of the \"bulls Molai,\" Maybe usual on the last Sunday of Carnival in the courtyard of the Palazzo Ducale.

This bridge, which offers a breathtaking view of St. dell'isole Michele and Murano, took the name from the nearby \"Sacca della Misericordia.\" The 'bag' we mean a place where the water comes in and almost form a sparse. Many of these bags once we had in Venice, but most of them went slowly burying. This operation was permitted by the Senate with the Decree of 3 december 1460 and continued in later times, as we read that in 1675, 12 were buried bags. La Sacca della Misericordia, where you can see the rafts of timber, is thus described by Nicander Jasseo: ........ stagnat, Planities square undis; pars fourth lacunae Iungitur, et fringes former triple tecta difficult surgunt. Orta procul quae vides ligna, ac wicker nexa, In molem congested Gravem, ratis ipsa simulque Great onus extiterant; hic solvunt blackberries tributum Postquam praecipiti SuperAnt declivia cursu Flumina. In the tip of the 'Sacca della Misericordia \"there is a\" Casino of the Spirits \", so called on account of the arcane noises in it that is listening reputation, products, perhaps by the wind or by reason of the echo, which refers distinctly from the casino all voices uttered at the end of the \"New Fondamente\" phenomenon considered at other times by popular superstition as a prestige evil. The intention is that the casino Zanotto acquistasse that name because it was the meeting place of 'the finest spirits and talents of the sixteenth century, such as Aretino, Titian etc.. We do not know whence Zanotto has drawn the surriferita news.",

They would like some of these names derive from patrician family Paradise, but is not found in any record that it possessed stable here, or is domiciled. Nor has memory that they stem from some other non-patrician family of the same name, as well as that painter Nicholas, who in one of his paintings date back to 1404 glue is called \"Nicolaus Paradixi,\" and an agreement from 1419 between the Fathers of the SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and the brotherhood of \"Ligadori\" of the German Warehouse, \"Nicholas depentor Heaven,\" was, according to the judgment of the most reputed writers, Nicoletto Semitecolo, and subscribed \"Paradise\" only because he lived, as expressed in a Another of his paintings, \"in Pontis Paradixi capita\", ie in this location. In addition, the name given to a more ancient time, and in some documents of the fourteenth century these roads do not appeal 'ca' Paradise, \"or\" Paradise \", but simply\" el Paradise. \" For these reasons we subscribe as soon as the opinion of the Dezan and others, who argue that the same roads you say \"Paradise\" for the magnificence waves were wont to adorn themselves, and lighting in the main feast of the church, and especially on Good Friday, the more that we do not Havva deficiency sacred memories, being the two wings of houses, which form the \"Calle del Paradiso,\" joint above the bridge with an arc, where scorgesi carved the image of B.

In fact, we know that having Pilgrim Foscari q. Michiel contract marriage in 1491 with Alvise Mocenigo \"from Zogie\ufffd q. Thomas, the property passed into the ownership of her Mocenigo. Therefore it Alvise Mocenigo notified in 1537 to X Savii over the Tithes, on behalf of Anthony, Francis, and Michiele his children, the \"basic cha Foscari\", including, besides the palace to S. Marina, the \"Ponte del Pistor,\" eranvi 'case n. 26 in the contr\ufffd of S. Maria Formoxa in the place called el Paradise, \"and another house\" in Contra de S. Lio. \" From this it follows that not the fourteenth century, but rather at the end of the fifteenth century, the work must be attributed arc indicated, since it is perhaps a play on the other front arch, or avendosi nell'architettarlo wanted to follow a more ancient style, and on the \"home statio\" to which it clings. That if, in any way, you want to judge in the fourteenth century, it behooves say in this case, that at least the arms Sieno been remitted, which does not pare.Non then it is unlikely that all the houses above, or at least some of them, belonged once more to the abbey of St. Maria della Pomposa, near Comacchio, as at the other arc, which is a knight of the \"Calle del Paradiso ', towards the' Salizzada of S. Lio, \"we read the following inscription, now corroded by time since last mccccvii die. de Zugno, fo comenzado these caxe misier don andrea soto de Abado pompous gastoldo pier zane de conteris.Ora tell an anecdote happened here in 1368. One evening of that certain \"Lorenzo di Bonfazio of seda 'knocked at the door of a certain Leonardo da Conegliano, player,\" here morabatur in Paradixo in S. contracta Leonis, \"warning him that to day he and other friends would come for him to make a morning in the S.

It is open the window, shouting to the neighbors, the seducer does escape, and returned her husband, tells him about the adventure. Leonardo mounts on the rampage, and wants to complain to justice, but friends try to calm him down, pointing out that in the end things were not processed beyond the limits of a simple attack. The good man does not believe, and only s'accheta when he goes to church of S. Lorenzo John Chrysostom, lights a doppiere, and swear on the sacred ciborium did not have coll'Armellina trade, and to be repented of attempted undertaken. Leonardo thus allows him to attend their home again, but alas! which reduces a fine day from Treviso, hear the neighbors having the thief committed adultery with his wife, and this moved to tears as she confesses that it was not able to resist the enticements of Lorenzo, and he had lain with him him four times, three in the house, and one from a shoemaker to the SS. Apostles. The 'rasps' of '' Avogaria \"do not say how to remain poor husband who only register Lorenzo, by judgment of 28 February 1368, M. See, he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment with a fine of five hundred francs, the Armellina to two months in prison by the loss of the dowry, and fellow Lorenzo to six months in prison with a fine of one hundred pounds. As for the other streets of Venice, which bear the name \"Paradise\", they even remember any family \"Paradise\", while the \"Sottoportico and the Court of Heaven\" at the \"Ruga Giuffa\" of S. Maria Formosa were anciently called \"Hell,\" and you can clearly see that in later times you took with best wishes renamed. The \"Calle\", then \"Paradise,\" the confluence \"Riva del Vin,\" he appealed, no doubt, from a pharmacy in the name of \"Paradise\", which existed above the shore. A Teodoro Balbi notified in 1661 that they have the \"middle of a workshop to be spicier medicines in contr\ufffd of S. Sylvester, sora the Riva del Vin, held for rent by Francesco Raffali spicier to Paradise. \" We read also in the \"Journal Solarium\" by Gioachino Burani, printed in Venice in 1794: \"At about two o'clock the following night the day of 25 November, the year 1753, a sudden and impetuous fire destroyed four houses at the Riva del Vino, in Rialto, together with two shops, a seller of hardware, and the other medicines in the name of the apothecary of Paradise, from which acquired the name of the adjacent street, subject to the district's Eve. \"",

        "History": "on rafts. The hospitable for Incurables was founded in 1522, by insinuation of St. Cajetan of Thiene, by Maria Malipiero and Marina Grimani, who had given shelter in a nearby house to three poor women from S. Rocco, suffering from venereal disease, then riputata incurable. From the beginning it was made of wood, and in the same year of its foundation was enlarged. In 1523, then there was erected beside a church, which is built in 1566 in most large and consecr\ufffd in 1600 under the invocation of SS. Savior. Even the hospitable probably was rebuilt in 1572. With regard to the architects, the disparities between the views, it is useful to believe that the model of the church has given Cav. Antonio Zentani, assisted by Sansovino, and that the factory was accomplished by Da Ponte, which is the main door of the hospitable, and which can be Yea, or in whole or in part, the same hospitable. This beautiful place was intended to first just sick of incurable diseases, but soon after orphans and cherubs are also accepted for educating them in Christian doctrine, nell'arti, and crafts. In effect we know that from 1531 to the Governors of the hospital called St. Jerome Miani, entrusting the care \"yes putti that of the sick,\" who went there taking with him other orphans, who had already gathered in a house near the church of S. Rocco. In the hospitable the Incurable used the same S. Francis Xavier, designed in 1537 to this office with four other companions from S. Ignatius Loyola. The direction of the pious, with regard to spiritual things, was first entrusted to the Clerks Regular of St. Gaetano, and afterwards to the Jesuits of which was Xavier, and lately in memory of Miani, clerics regular Somasca. Pell'assistenza dell'inferme and pell'educazione of the maidens in the early years there were twelve noble women, and for the care of sick some gentlemen, which came to an end as a result, and governors, chosen from among the nobles and citizens , took care of everything coll'ajuto of people employed. After 1782 the Superintendent shrank in the person of a governor only. The maidens educated in this hospice learned the music, and they were celebrated in song. In 1807 the club was the Incurable use of Hospitable Civic, and in 1819 was reduced to barracks, as is found nowadays. In this circumstance closed the church, which existed where nowadays opens the courtyard and came to serve as a store of materials Army Corps of Engineers, until, stripped of marble, altars and paintings, it was completely demolished in 1831.",

Juliana of the Counts of Collalto, took the habit of St. Benedict in the cloister of Salvarola at Este, and came to Venice in 1222, he founded the Giudecca a church dedicated to SS. Biagio and Cataldo, and a Benedictine monastery, where formerly stood another older church, under the same invocation of the saints, and a hospice is intended to accommodate the pilgrims who went to the Holy Land. In 1519 the monastery was reformed by the patriarch Antonio Contarini, and in the same century was also materially renovated probably together with the church. Ambidue buildings had another rifabbrica in the past century, but in 1810 were reduced to profane uses. In recent years, were destroyed to give rise to a novel building for commercial use. Writes the Sanudo, February 15, 1513 under M. V.: \"In these zorni to S. Biaxio Catoldo follow certain cuestione each other nuns who treteno books in his head.

Catherine Sacchi. Borlotta was the daughter of the famous Nicholas Giustiniani, monaco already in S. Nicol\ufffd del Lido, released from the cloister with the permission of the pope, who joined Anna and Michiel succession to give to your family. In 1807 the nuns of S. Catherine were concentrated with those of S. Alvise, and placed himself at their monastery High School boarding school, now called Marco Foscarini. The church became then, as it is, however, sacramental chapel of the establishment. It was the day of the Holy owner visited by the Prince, and the Lordship because on that day, on a point of Doge Pietro Gradenigo (an. 1307, was celebrated the so-called \"Festa dei Dotti,\" and schiudevansi places of public education (25 November.

They devised the wild youth to disturb the enterprise, and the night set you put armed to buzz around the convent, for which the Giustiniani, who came to the post, he had to retire as a precaution. Another night then, with the help of the UN Giacomo Nanni q. John, scaled the walls of the sacred enclosure, where was penetrated the nun, and making them believe that the Contarini was Giustiniani, entertained themselves in the dark with it. Scopertosi the fact, the Contarini and Erizzo were convicted, by judgment of 14 May 1446, to a year in jail and a fine of 100 pounds pel sacrilege committed. then The Dwarves and the Giustiniani to six months in prison, and fined the same, these for his connection to kidnap the nun, and those for giving hand to climb the convent.",

        "History": "to S. Martin. Some derive the word 'Arsenal' (in Dante 'Arzan\ufffd') from 'dammed', ie enclosed by embankments. The Sansovino from \"Senatus Marx\" (fortress or stronghold of the Senate). The Ducange from \"ars\", which in low Latin means \"car.\" The Gallicciolli from \"harras\", which among Orientals means \"facitura instruments of metalwork.\" The Masons, with more truth than all, by \"dock\" a word of Arabic origin, which indicates the place where they manufacture and guard the ships.\nOur Arsenal was founded around 1104, under the doge Ordelafo Falier, but bought the best shape, and was the first addition in 1303, or 1304, when, on the model, as it seems, of Andrea Pisano, there had constructed new sites, as well as the \"Tana\" or \"House of C\ufffdnevo,\" afterwards rebuilt in 1579 by Antonio Da Ponte. He got a second addition in 1325 ('New Arsenal'), a third in 1473 (\"Brand New Arsenal '), a fourth shortly before 1539 (\" Allocation of Galeazze \"), and a fifth in 1564 (\" Channel of Galeazzo and Bath \"). Other additions followed in 1810 coll'aggregamento of the church and monastery of Celestia, then suppressed, and others in 1820 and 1828, although these very little relief. The complex of these distributions is protected by the turreted walls, forming an enclosure of about two geographical miles.\nThe entrance of the Arsenale is closed by a gate, advanced-constructed in 1682, with eight statues surmounting the pillars, which include pagan deities, the works of F. Cabianca and G. Comino, and with four lions around of Pentelic marble, brought to Venice from Attica in 1687, to about Francesco Morosini said Peloponnesiaco. The gate, built in 1460 on the design, as it seems, of Friar Giocondo, coll'insegna of S. Mark the attic, was decorated in 1571 by the figures in high relief to the hips, and in 1578 a statue of St. Justina on top, sculpted by Country in memory of the triumph of the Curzolari. It was then converted in 1688 to almost triumphal arch, with warlike emblems and trophies, in honor of the Peloponnesian.\nOur Arsenal suffered various conflagrations, the most terrible of which was what happened just before the War of Cambrai, almost foreboding of evil overlying then to the Republic. Another succumbed to serious fire in 1569. Not so, says the Berlan at that time such was the prosperity of the Venetian power, which a year later by that same Arsenal came out of the fleet that destroyed the Turkish naval forces in the Gulf of Lepanto.\nThe government of the Arsenal was entrusted to the early days, three patricians called \"Superintendents' or 'Patrons Arsenal', to which were added in 1490 by the Senate two individuals of their body, and a third in 1498, with the title \"Sopra Superintendents at Arsenal.\" For the tasks entrusted to these two magistrates, and the laws relating to the Arsenale, see mainly the Tentori (\"Essay on the History of Civil etc.. Republic of Venice\").\nIn \"Field Arsenal\ufffd scorgesi a pilot of bronze that supports the standard, and that was cast in 1693 by Gianfrancesco Alberghetti. This field ampliossi in 1797.\nOne of the two decks of wood Arsenal, that is what is closest to the field said, Yea is called \"Paradise\", a building that was so entitled, and which, together with the other two \"Purgatory\" and \"the 'Inferno', prospettanti the \"Foundation face Arsenal\" and at one time residence of the \"Superintendents 'or' Patrons at Arsenal.\"\nEven the \"Foundation Arsenal,\" which is to the right of whoever gets to come from the \"Riva degli Schiavoni\", he, with his neighbor stream, the other name \"Madonna\" by a church dedicated to the Virgin, and demolished in 1809.",

Joseph Briati drew back for three years in Bohemia, and learned the art of reducing the crystal glass, the introduced among us in 1730. He built a beautiful first a small furnace in Murano, but envied by Murano, which assailed him at night with firearms, obtained in 1739 to transport to Venice in the room mentioned. \"He,\" says the cons. Giovanni Rossi in a glimpse of his unpublished work on the costumes, and the Laws of the Venetians, reported by Stork, \"showed him to cultivate a distinct talent. It contained not the subject of which he undertook would move and not imitation, and flowers and fruits, and bridges, and gardens, and animals and figures, reduced everything to perfection. Then for all the tables all the lords pompeggiarono the vague adornments, called dezert, and these, often of pasta, sugar and porcelain became almost all glass, and glass Briati, abbellendosene the same lunches public of the Doge. \" Even Nicander Jasseo, after talking to a gentleman's house of Zenobius, owner of the building located on the opposite Foundation, appoints the factory Briati with the two verses:\nHunc against insudat sufflando factory vitro\nUnique in urbe, tuis sed quae omnia Dabit votis.\n\nIt is not true then, as said the Bussolin in his small 'Guide to Factories Murano glassworks, \"that the factory went Briati closed around 1790. It continued to exist to Carmini, under the same company, even in the beginning of the current century.\nThe \"Bridge Briati\" is also called \"the Martini\" from a family so cognominata, which formerly lived at the same. A daughter of \"Piero Martini by Carmini 'married in 1434 the number U. Happy Bon. Then on the occasion of Redecima of 1566, \"the Alberto Martini fo de m. Alvise 'notified' a home from statio what I Live in Contra de S. Rafael, near the bridge to go alli Carmini. \" And the \"Chronicle of the original families of the city\" (Class VII, Code 27 of Marciana) talking about the Martini, so he says, \"is found in this Bernardin what has to Carmini home and lives of entrada.\" This family came among us in the fourteenth century with merchants and silk weavers Lucchesi. He produced some of the Knights of Malta, including quell'Andrea that, as he said the inscription had been affected in 1580 by the heirs above his tomb in the church of S. Cross the Giudecca, it was clear to many honors, he became worthy of religion, and occupossi throughout his life with the highest praise in the affairs of princes.",

This small hospital, or small hospital, was founded in 1527 by the surgeon Gualtieri in a place that was called the military exertions by \"Target.\" Here gathered the sick, and after a fair famine they had multiplied enormously in our city, and afterwards they were joined by orphans. Very deserving of the pious place became S. Jerome Miani, and also, as it is known, S. Ignatius Loyola. The adjoining church, built in L528 under the title of S. Maria dei Derelitti, was rebuilt in 1674 for bonded Bartolammeo Carnioni, haberdasher in \"haberdashery S. Savior \"in the name of the Ostrich, on the design of Baldassare Longhena, who shall overloaded the facade of marble and sculptures. The hospitable, also rebuilt on the design of Matteo Lucchesi, lasted until 1807, when it was reduced to a House of Refuge for old men and needy and helpless. In our time had a magnification. Now, for the new path laid behind the apse of the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, the \"Sottoportico and Calle dell'Ospedaletto\" were closed. He says that once a chronicle \"It contained the brand all'Ospedaletto Santi Giovanni e Paolo in the house on which starts to San Marco.\" The Gallicciolli, remembering that even in 'its time you had a free home minister brand, believes that there is minted coins eroded, or \"maggiorine,\" that is mixed with copper. But it is certain that there is only melted the gold attendant to the mint, since the description of the Contrada di Santa Maria Formosa 1661 marks around the pel '\"Ospedaletto\" the \"Foundry of the brand,\" as well as the homes of Thomas Premuda, Lattanzio Zucconi, and Alessandro Rizzo, granted to them \"for loading the foundry.\" And \"Notatori of Gradenigo\" so they say in the May 15, 1771: \"Reduced falling outside the walls of the enclosure where the public is purified and refined gold attendant to the minting of coins varied in proportion to the weight of similar metal, ordered the Their Excellencies Superintendents Above the Mint that are completely renovated and remittances, ristaurando also full of very prejudiced et infracidito. \" This situation, adjacent to Riding behind the church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, is not far from Fondamente Nuove.",

Pollani John, Bishop of Castello, donated it in 1138 to Manfredo, abbot of Fruttuaria, the Cistercian Congregation of St. Benedict, who enlarged it and he built a monastery next to the abbey of employee Fruttuaria. The church of S. Daniel was solemnly consecrated in 1219 by Cardinal Ugolino Ostiense, afterwards Pope Gregory IX. Now is the fifteenth century, the prior Vincenzo from Sibenik gave the Church with the monastery to the pious woman Chiara Ogniben Sustan, through the work of which, in 1437, the Benedictines were replaced by Augustinian nuns. At the time of secularization of the monasteries on buildings of which we speak became barracks. The church then was completely demolished in 1839, and the convent is still barracks of the Royal Man.",

Maria Formosa, and located on the altar of Donato. See the inscription referred to the 'capital' at the Bridge, and in the church at the altar suaccennato.\nThe house itself was the seat later dell'Uffizio Lotto, which in 1734 was taken into contract for a decade.

In 1080 the family Cattaneo made to erect a church to St. John Chrysostom, which in 1488, for assertion of the priest Lodovico Talents there once stood in bad state pei ravages of time, to which some add those to the near fire, which occurred in 1475. It was therefore rebuilt in 1497 on the design, as he writes Flaminio Corner, architect Tullio Lombardo, but not in the old situation, but in the face of the same. It was the parish, and it was only in 1810 that it became a branch of S. Canciano. Sanudo reports that the February 3 1531 M. V. the Council de 'Pregadi imposed on the Superintendents of the City to spread her \"Salizzada of S. John Chrysostom, \"which was very narrow, and therefore having to land the bell tower, he allowed himself to the rector space to fabricate a new one. See \"Senate, Earth,\" R. 26.",

The church and monastery of St. Maria Humility once belonged to the Teutonic Knights, but about half of the sixteenth century allowed themselves to the fathers of the Society of Jesus, who in 1589 ristaurarono them. Parties, however, the Jesuits from Venice in 1606, the aforesaid edifices remained empty and abandoned, until in 1615 they were entrusted to the Benedictine nuns of the convent of S. Servolo. They remained there until 1806 when they were concentrated with those of S. Lorenzo. In 1824 the church and the monastery of St. Maria Humility is landed along with a chapel nearby, dedicated to St. Philip Blacks, to expand the garden of the seminary. About the \"Bridge of Humility\" writes the continuation of Berlan: \"The passenger in the present day, despite himself, this bridge is stopped or longer follows the journey of the rafts, and the ride to the tip of the Customs to the field of Health. The bridge was closed by the wall when, about 1851, the Customs of S. George was transferred here. \"",

        "History": ". Rialto was one of the largest islands in which in the beginning of the ninth century was transported from Malamocco the ducal seat. This island gained its name from the little river \"Realto,\" or \"Prealto ', which, according to some, along with a branch of the Brenta, scorreale from beside, or more likely on the height and fullness of the channel to which it was lapped, or the high position in comparison to the surrounding islands, so it is said, \"Riva high\" whence Rivoalto and Rialto. Formerly dividevasi into two parts, one of which, called \"ultra canalem,\" embraced the current Rialto, and the other, called \"extra canalem,\" that space where later arose the churches of S. Bartolammeo, S. Salvatore, S. Marco, S. Maria Formosa. Sometimes in the early days prendevasi Rialto Venice whole, and in fact it might be said the main part, because it contained the public palace, the main courts, the prisons, the body of the guards, the gymnasium, the hole merchant, and the warehouses of the effects more preziosi.Il first Rialto bridge was erected over boats in 1175, or 1180, by Nicholas Starattoni, or Barattieri. Like the Foundation, which currently is said of the \"Iron\", was called \"the Money\" for the next tick. See Iron (Foundation. Costrusse In 1265 about styles, and lasted until 1310 when it was cut off the retreat of Bajamonte Tiepolo.

        "History": "to S. Marco. From the houses where, with the remainder of the clergy in charge of the Basilica, resided the canons of S. Marco. They formerly dicevansi chaplains, and their comeback all'829 institution in which, as he says Pier Giustiniani in its history, the Doge Giovanni Partecipazio \"primicerium et cappellanos instituit, here diurnum nocturnumque officium divinis laudibus celebrarent.\" Varied the number of these canons, leggendosi that in 1393, when the Doge Antonio Venier alquanti they invested, they found themselves at number 26, and that in recent centuries narrowed to 12 only. The houses of their residence were addressed to them by the Doge Ziani. Were rebuilt in 1210 by Angelo Falier, only then Attorney S. Marco, and reduced in stone in 1346. The string in his Additions to the \"Venice\" of Sansovino, published in 1604, which refers to 'his times were 24, arranged as follows: 12 canons resident pei, pei sacrestani 2, 5 sottocanonici pei, pei sottosacrestani 2, 1 pel master of the chapel, and the other 2 pei guardians of the church. The sixth of sottocanonici had also formerly the home, but it had been demolished because, being too close to the basilica, might cause her danger of fire, and in return received from the above-mentioned sottocanonico Procuratia a corresponding compensation in cash. For proof of the same string, then these homes had the look of a convent with a courtyard in the middle, well equipped, and surrounded by porticoes on the floor, and an upper hallway. The entry then, as evidenced by the manuscript work of Todeschini, cited elsewhere, with the title: \"the dignity of the Procurators of S. Marco, \"was on the side of the square of S. Basso. From 1597 until the prosecutors had devised to rebuild the Canonica, but, for various impediments that there frapposero, this had no effect before 1618, terminandosi the work in 1635.\nA proud if born in the year 1456 Canonica di San Marco. It contained a priest in Venice Victor, man of evil nature, and, according to this' superstitious times, linked in friendship with the devil, who held the bag to his rascality \"in the form canis books.\" He, knowing that in the Rectory of St. Marco lived a canonical Mauro d'Otranto, wealthy man, he climbed onto the roof of the house with him, and for the fireplace filled the room he inhabited. The canon was then singing in church in the morning, so that pre 'Victor went meanwhile examining where he kept his money, and thereafter, for to await the opportune time, he hid \"in callicella lecti.\" When he returned to the canon, if hurled, he struggled long with the same, and it was not until maybe you saw less of forces that broke from the fray, and besought him to let him go. He did agree the canon, and prepared to accompany pre 'Victor outside the door, but these, feigning fear, wanted precede him, and when he reached the end of the staircase, threw a rope around his neck, trying to choke him with his hands Yea. This gave rise to fight more fair; pre 'Victor shook, pre' Mauro biting the hands of pre 'Victor, as long as they brandished his sword, in order to pre' Mauro was girded, and stabbed him in the throat. After that dragged the corpse in the street, threw him on the wood, and began to steal the house. For this crime pre 'Victor was put to the torture, and, having first of the patriarchal vicar Nicholas by Croci, confessed everything, was demoted, and surrendered to the secular, March 19, 1456 that he did hang on the forks.\nThe \"Ponte di Canonica\" was erected, according to many commentators, after the murder committed over Vitale Michiel II in 1172, and this because the doges were marked with the day of Easter, not for the \"Riva degli Schiavoni\", but for within, to visit the church of S. Zechariah. See Rasse (Calle delle). Others want the same bridge was erected somewhat earlier, ie in 864, after the murder of Doge Pietro Tradonico. This rifabbrica above plan of Antonio Mazzoni, date from 1755.\nAt the \"Bridge,\" and above the \"Rio di Canonica\" Lombard is a magnificent palace, which was the first Trevisan, and afterwards of the hat. Some believed that these thresholds fled in 1563 the famous Bianca Cappello. But the documents discovered in its stead proved that the palace, where White lived, is located on the 'Crooked Bridge' in S. Apollinaris. V. Storto (Bridge). It but, when he was already fled from Venice, and was in Florence mistress of the Grand Duke, bought the palace of \"Canonica\" by N. U. Domenico Trevisan q.

Now we need to branch in S. John Bragora. Its bell tower was built around the middle of the past century, since the priest Antonio Fusarini, who died in 1762, said he was on the tombstone \"auctor sacrae turris.\" This church in 1819 was the scene of a strange adventure. In it riparossi a big elephant, escaped, with great fear of the population, from his menagerie on the \"Riva degli Schiavoni.\" Not being worth balls rifle to kill him, it was necessary to have recourse to the gunners, who pinned a colubrina, they did finally fall lifeless on the ground. The fact breathed \"the Elefanteide\" of the famous Buratti. See also the pamphlet entitled \"The elefanticidio Venice in the year 1819 of the noble Mr. Peter Bonmartini Padovano. Venice, Andreola, 1819. \"",

In this way they wanted to give a reward to those worthy men who had labored in fishing, and most could not, as a youth, endure hardships, vigils, and dangers. The \"Compravendi fish,\" gathered in the church of B. V. Carmine under the protection of St. Nicholas, while the Fishermen possessed a special school of devotion, located outside of the church itself, and dedicated to St. Alberto, as well as others in other churches.

Maria degli Angeli in Murano, first erected in the city, and afterwards outside the walls of Treviso, a monastery under the Rule of St. Augustine, dedicated to St. Jerome. However Dall'Armi terrified of Louis, King of Hungary, abandoned it, and came to Venice in 1364, retiring to a house in San Vitale. Then, for the bounties of the priest Giovanni Contarini, they were able to raise another convent adjoining the church, dedicated to St. Jerome likewise. In 1425 they gave more dimension to these buildings, which burned in 1456 and refitted at the expense of the Senate, unharmed lasted until the year 1705, in which succumbed to fire again. After this disaster arose again standing for the piety of the faithful. Finally, the suppression of religious orders, were converted to private use. Having Francesco Poza wounded in the church of St. Jerome in the arm of Peter France, chief guardian of the Heads of the districts, 3 April 1475 was banned from Venice and its district, breaking the contract which had to be on the \"Bridge of S. Jerome \"deprived of his right hand and tongue.",

It seems that the establishment of the parish was contemporary to that of the church. In 1810 he joined the greater part of the parish of St. Sofia then suppressed, but ordered to remove some districts that were added to that of the SS. Apostles. The ancient \"Ponte S.

According to the Dezan, lived, or had stable, in this situation the family cittadinesca Wonder, or \"Maravegia ', famous for quell'Alessandra sister of John Wonder, Secretary of the Senate, and wife of Peter Albino, chancellor of the kingdom of Cyprus, which, after the capture of Nicosia, taken prisoner with many Cypriot, burned, first to set sail for Constantinople, to the place of ammunition, and burned not only the ship where was, and still self-inflicted, but was that the reason s'appiccasse wood fire with two other neighbors, and that all the prisoners perished there collected. We do not want silence, however, that the origin of the name given to the \"Bridge of the Maravegie\" (wonders run two fantastic folk traditions, reported by Pull\ufffd in his notes to the \"Songs of the people Veneziano\" of Foscarini. Narrates the bridge before it was so said because it was beautifully built in one night by unknown hands, having been put in use this' materials that the day before there had been prepared to give principle at work. says that in the face of the second bridge that lived seven sisters, six of such as beautiful, and a bad. had begun to attend their home a young boatman, but from that moment on, healthy and robust, and had become so weak that he ammalaticcio rimanergli sufficient forces to engage in an upcoming race. He then believed himself bewitched, and his suspicion fell on the seventh ugly sister called Marina, which, though sometimes he saw him, he tried to escape it. Wanting revenge, therefore, and having chosen one evening when, to be on Good Friday, the father and the other sisters had gone to visit the 'graves', walked towards the house of the Navy, but he was going to commit pell'atto startled, stopped for a few minutes before the bridge. Suddenly the window for the alleged sorceress knelt before a crucifix, and in the same spot he looked up to heaven, he saw blazing six stars, arranged in the shape of a wagon, with the wheel and the rudder, preceded by a seventh small and dim. Gradually, however, the six shiny lost splendor, and became more beautiful the seventh, until the other vanished, and she was left only to shine in the sky. The sight of her kneeling praying, as well as the prodigy, who, for a mysterious feeling, the relationship seemed to have co 'cases its , entirely changed the mind of the boatman, and diffilato him into the house, where, when asked if it was true that the Navy had bewitched, and that he wanted to kill him, this crying manifested the love hidden for him in the breast fed , and told him that at that moment I prayed to God to let her die in stead of him. Intenerissi tai said to the boy, and since it is a short step from compassion to love, too, soon began to correspond with the feelings of the girl , so, left aside the thoughts of death, and regained his health, he won the race, and had the Marina in marriage. Since then, the bridge over which he saw the wonder of the seven stars, with good reason called avrebbesi \" of Maravegie \"(wonders.

        "History": "\ufffdto S. Eustace. From Pesaro palace, which was started over design Longhena in 1679, as we read in Roman numerals on a sign hand-held by a statue of the prospectus, and that was fulfilled in 1710. It would seem, however, that above that area there was a tenement belonging to the oldest Pesaro, since they are written to the Doge Giovanni Pesaro, born in 1590, he fell in his childhood from the palace of his family in the parish of St. Eustace. Here he sought a refuge on the last Doge Ludovico Manin after his abdication to the principality. The Pesaro, just the genealogist Barbaro came to Venice in 1225 from the city of this name in Romagna, where dicevansi Palmieri, and were exalted state. Yes many men of merit in the toga made clear in arms this family. Who has not known that Benedetto Pesaro, generalissimo of the sea, who had him beheaded on the prow of his galley istessa the infidel Carlo Contarini, conquered Cephalonia, S. Maura, and Alessio, freed from the siege of Naples Romania, and died in Corfu in 1503 after having been honorably marked the peace? They are also memorable actions of Jerome son of Benedict, James Bishop of Paphos, elected in 1501 by Pope apostolic legate and general of the papal linked to that of the Venetians, as well as Francesco archbishop of Zadar, then owner patriarch of Constantinople, and finally appointed by the Senate bishop of Brescia, who died in 1544. Nor should it be forgotten Giovanni Pesaro, made doge in 1658, a man famous for maturity of counsel, for various embassies incurred before, and have passionately harangued before the fathers lest you continue the war against the Turkish. In the code of Gradenigo, sometimes referred to with the title \"Memorable Cases Venetians, 'states that the election of the doge, was seen attached to the walls of the city the following sign: Live from the Pesaro Dear, What is it going in preson for laro, And last madness, The Bride \ufffd Dona Maria. Not knowing how, however, that the Doge Pesaro has no married woman named Mary, we may assume that the aforementioned satire is output instead thereof at the time of a Procurator of St. Marco Leonardo Pesaro, nephew of the Doge (an. 1649 which in 1648 had married Marietta Giovanni Priuli. Here then, for that addition of ispiegazione 'by the Chariot', must know that the Pesaro family was so nicknamed because it belonged that machine, made in wagon form, which carried the boats from the channel-Lizza Fusina to the lagoon, and from this to that, in 1324 it enabled once commanded of erecting a dam in chief of the same channel because the waters of the Brenta isgorgassero in the lagoon. was taken from the bank in 1561, and raised the 'wagon', building in its stead the \"Gates of Moranzan ', which were also of the jurisdiction of Pesaro, for which reason, when the same in 1613 declared themselves to public law, Pesaro received compensation. Pesaro The family rebuilt the church of St. John the Beheaded, costrusse, as well as various palaces, a magnificent altar, and sumptuous mausoleums in the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, and gave the name more streets of Venice. Conscience, that in times closer to us produced that prosecutor Francesco di S. Marco, and a large proponent of armed neutrality at the fall of the Republic, went extinct in the minor brother Francesco, who had incurred the charge ambassador in Rome.",

Marsilio from the Cross, in his \"History of the public et Vinegia famous entry into the most serene Henry III, King of France and Poland,\" says that, having to do such a war, \"there you wanted to find his Majesty, as he had wanted more times , to enjoy yet this other entertainment and amusement, and was reduced later on with them princes and lords in the house of Jacomo clarissimo Foscarini, Ambassador, by the bridge. Announcement was made immediately, otherwise the galley, that all those who montassero on the bridge before the tips cut off to 'their sticks, and on pain of death to those who pulled stones, put his hand to arms, and does cause some turmoil, or other disadvantages, such as other times it's happened, and the captains, the orders of their masters, they were armed guard to prevent all scandals. His Majesty shewn see the windows, which were apparate cloths of gold with its pillows of the same, comparsero in the field by one o'clock side and the other by about two hundred fighters ... and there mounted above the said bridge, two by two, now a part, now the other to make the exhibition, then only just began to pull alquanti shots until much later that clung to the whole frotta, that lasted more than half an hour, scacciandosi now one, now et others down the bridge, and sometimes down again, lowering his adversaries that he had been driven out, giving himself several times the charge in droves different one o'clock side and the other, and also sometimes remaining patrons of the bridge, the result that his Majesty saw this great battle, and enjoyed with its great taste and amusement, which could very well for the beautiful droves that you'll eventually did, and for the great multitude of the combatants fell in the plunging many on the ground, and others rushed in various ways in the water on both sides ... et in gratitude that they had diportati much, they were all winners, giving himself to both parties for a hundred and fifty ducats, and twenty-five of cooling, such as money spent them the one and the other parties in doing dances, hunts for bulls , artificali fires, and others of similar entertainments, each part in its sestiero. \" The quoted Giacomo Foscarini, who hosted in 1574 King Henry III, was brave general and sea, who died in 1602, had a splendid monument in the church of the Carmine. This line of Foscarini went extinct in the prosecutor Pietro, who died in 1745, whose widow Elizabeth Corner gave 3 August 1749 in his palace of the Carmine a wonderful dance party, with music and songs, the most serene family of Modena. This party was represented in an engraving of Filosi.Abbiamo by reporters that the family Foscarini, from which other between our ways appealed, came from Altino, or from Padua, in the year 867, and which formerly was called Cobeschini, but the way change name in 1297, an era in which it remained the Council. He produced various famous people.
